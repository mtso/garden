## User Stories

1. All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.
1. I can move throughout a map, discovering items.
1. I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.
1. Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.
1. When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.
1. When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.
