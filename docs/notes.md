# Notes

Items have a function that take in the player as a parameter and returns a new player? (mutates the player's stats) (which are level, exp, health, attack, armor?)

Each level of experience increases the chance of encountering the boss floor
Each level also increases the size of the next floor
A higher power level of your weapon and armor also increases the chance of encountering the boss floor

player object needs to have health, level, weapon, position, experience (level)
item types are: weapon, health augmentation


each cell should keep track of the last time the player stepped through

each component needs to update for each loop (one player step)
